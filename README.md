# How to Undo Mistakes in Git using Command Line

### 1. Discarding all local changes in a file

> You make some changes in a local file and haven't make a commit yet and noticed it's not a better version and you want to go to the last commited version.

`git restore <file_name>`

Note: Discarding uncommitted local changes can not be undone!

### 2. Restoring deleted files

> You not only make some changes but also deleted that file and you want that file back

`git restore <file_name>
